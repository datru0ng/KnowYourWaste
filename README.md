# KnowYourWaste

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What is KnowYourWaste?

KnowYourWaste is a project I made for my HCDE 438 class. I wanted to create an app that would allow people to easily know how to throw their trash away. By taking a picture of your waste, the app would automatically detect what part of the waste is either trash, recycle, or compost. This project is still incomplete because of the time contraint I had while making this. I do plan on working more on this project eventually. 

## How to use KnowYourWaste?

Once this app is completed, you should be able to just take a picture of your item and the app will somehow know what your item is.Then it will tell you what part of your waste is trash, recycle, or compost.
